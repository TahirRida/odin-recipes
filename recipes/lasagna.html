        · Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.<br>
        · Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.<br>
        · Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.<br>

        · Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.<br>
        · Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</p>
