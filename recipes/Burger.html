        Recipe's ingredients
    </h3>
    <p class="stepsparagraph">
        Slice, dice, and mash: Whether you're using beans or vegetables, be sure to mash beans and dice veggies to make the components as small as possible. This makes it much easier for the final burgers to hold together when cooking. And if you have one, let your food processor do the work for you.<br><br><br>
        Make-ahead and freeze: Meatless burgers of all kinds are easy to prepare ahead of time, and they freeze great. Wrap patties individually in plastic, then store together in a freezer-friendly resealable plastic bag. To defrost, lay them flat in a single layer (as opposed to stacked — this'll cut down your defrost time) in the fridge overnight or for a few hours. You can also go straight from the freezer to cooking; just be sure your burger centers are hot before serving.
        Mix and match ingredients: When it comes to the beans and the veggies, pretty much anything goes in vegetarian burger recipes. Any bean can be swapped for whatever you have on hand. And if you don't have quite enough red bell pepper? Use a different color, or try grated carrots instead. Just be sure you avoid veggies that contain a lot of water, like cucumber.<br><br><br>
        Get your grill on. If lots of veggie burgers are in your future, consider investing in a fine-mesh grill topper. These can be placed right on the grill; and with smaller openings than the typical grill, they provide a more solid surface for veggie burgers, making it much less likely for them to fall apart while cooking. Bonus: You can use the grill topper when you grill small items that might otherwise fall through the grates, such as vegetables and shrimp.<br>
